<ul><a href="binarySearch.js">Binary Search</a>
    <p>is an efficient algorithm for finding a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the target with the middle element, continues on the left half if the target is smaller, or the right half if larger, and repeats until the element is found or the interval is empty. Its time complexity is O(log n).</p>
</ul>

<ul><a href="linearSearch.js">Linear Search</a>
    <p>is a simple algorithm for finding a target element in an array by checking each element one by one from start to end until the target is found or the array ends. Its time complexity is O(n).</p>
</ul>
<ul><a href="bubbleSort.js">Bubble Sort</a>
    <p>is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements in an array if they are in the wrong order, passing through the array multiple times until it is sorted. Its time complexity is O(n²).</p>
</ul>
<ul><a href="insertionSort.js">Insertion Sort</a>
    <p>is a simple sorting algorithm that builds a sorted portion of the array one element at a time by comparing each new element with the sorted elements and inserting it in the correct position. Its time complexity is O(n²).</p>
</ul>
<ul><a href="mergeSort.js">Merge Sort</a>
    <p>is divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits an array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together in order. Its time complexity is O(n log n).</p>
</ul>
<ul><a href="quickSort.js">Quick Sort</a>
    <p>is divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions. Its average time complexity is O(n log n).</p>
</ul>
<ul><a href="quickSortM.js">Quick Sort With Median Of Three</a>
    <p>is a variation of quick sort that chooses the pivot as the median of the first, middle, and last elements to improve partitioning and reduce the chance of worst-case performance. It partitions the array around this pivot and recursively sorts the subarrays, maintaining an average time complexity of O(n log n).</p>
