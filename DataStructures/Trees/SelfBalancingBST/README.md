<h2>What is AVL?</h2>
<p><b><i>AVL</i></b> tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. This balance is maintained through automatic rebalancing operations, like rotations, after insertions and deletions, which ensures that search, insertion, and deletion operations have a guaranteed time complexity of (O(log n)). </p>

<h2>What is Red-Black Tree</h2>
<p><b><i>Red-Black Tree</b></i> is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node is colored either red or black to maintain balance. This color-coding, along with a set of rules, ensures the tree remains approximately balanced, which guarantees that search, insertion, and deletion operations have an average time complexity of (O(logn)). </p>
